# My First Go Code
This is my first repo on Go Lang. It is just very simple api handler, nothing else. So Yeah enjoy it.

## What I learn from this code
From this code, i learn basic syntax of Go lang and how we can implement that as web app. In a first glance it feels like node app. If you want to clone this repo and int on your local machine just run `go run main.go` on your clone directory and it just works well. Maybe if you are in windows, windows will prompting you to whether to accept it to run or not.
